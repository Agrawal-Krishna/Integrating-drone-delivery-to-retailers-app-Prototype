# Mobile-app-drone-delivery-prototype





# Original Problem: 
‘Big box retailers want to attract more Millennials/Gen Y customers’. 

Customer Centric Reframing: ‘Young working Millennials want big box retailers to better meet their shopping needs’.
# Product Vision Statement: 
To enhance the big box customers shopping experience by faster, efficient, and sustainable product delivery.
# The Solution- 
We want to deliver a smooth seamless delivery service to the customer. We envision the drone to fly with a carriage that stores the product.
# The Challenges -
We will elaborate on unforeseen challenges in the viability of the solution. As Drone delivery is a novel technology there are some logistic challenges that need to be addressed. In recent times drones have become a more prevalent technology and innovations that suits are needed. Following are the challenges faced and raised since the last presentation.

- Since it’s a nascent product we plan to launch it in Suburban and rural America first. As per American Housing survey (AHS), 52% households are in suburban and 21% in rural. 90% of the US population stays 10 miles from a Walmart store, 75% for Target. The network effect of the big box retailers has access to the customers and drone delivery will be providing them with a competitive edge.
- At present there are 12 drone delivery companies in the market such as Zipline, Wing and Flytrex. The big delivery giants such as UPS, Amazon and Volvo are also invested in the technology. Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Virginia already have drone delivery with 6000 successful deliveries from Walmart alone. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has Part 135 regulations which dictates the criteria for Registration, flying, remote ID and load carrying for the drones under community-based organization.
- The drone will be automated with GPS tracking and will be able to guide themselves to and back to the store for reloading. Companies like Zipline are making 500 deliveries per day. The drones can sustain themselves in all kinds of weather conditions.
The delivery method is challenging as it needs to be precise, secure and enable easy delivery. Since we are targeting the Suburb and rural America, all the houses have backyards that are secure for delivery identified and prevent the package from porch pirates. Technical aspects can be explained during the presentation.
- Customer interaction will happen with the assistance of the application that would provide them with the location of their package, estimated delivery time and other similar information. Their delivery will be automated but and for returns customers will be able to interact with the drone carriage.
The Drones will be operating from a separate dedicated Sub section of the big box retailers’ stores.
- A major concern is the noise from the drones. Recent innovations from the biomimicry of the silent flight of the owl, has led to the development of silent drone propellers that could deliver products at very low decibel levels. The Drones will operate at heights that would be unobtrusive to the people and will lower the self-stabilizing carriage to deliver the product precisely even in high winds and rain.
- The average weight delivered is generally below 5 pounds. But the present carrying capacity of the drones are 55 pounds. The delivery option is dedicated to small, non-fragile items such as Apparel, Toiletries etc. The Application will determine based on the drone capacity and highlight the user when the capacity is reached allowing them to choose from multiple drone or traditional delivery options.
- The Application will only show drone delivery option if it is available in the customer zip code (taken from their address) 


# Prototype- 
Our team will be making a Clickable high fidelity visual with focus on the following use cases:

Login screen – The user will be able to login using their preferred social media login and strong password. Login provides security and quick access to the products on the site.

Home screen – The user will have access to quick search options and filters based on their zip code. The home screen will also avail the user to sales and other discounts available on the platform.

Product screen – The user will be able to understand the product offerings, price and will have the option of buying the product with customizable delivery locations. Registered users will be able to create wish lists and come back to their order or change order.

Shopping Cart – The user will be able to see the total cost of all items in the cart and available discounts, save for future purchase.

Delivery information screen – The user will be able to see the available delivery options in their zip code.
Delivery Method screen – The user will see what items are eligible for drone delivery by icon and the option of choosing other modes of delivery.

Check out screen – The screen gives the user swift payment option for future purchases.
 
Order Confirmation screen – The user will be able to cancel, track change in the delivery.

Feedback screen – The user will have an opportunity to express their concerns and areas of improvement in their experience.

Return Initiation screen – The user will be able to quickly return products with clarity and no extra cost or travel.

Timeline- The team will work on 2-week sprints. For the creation of the prototype, we will be beginning with the high difficulty sections moving on to the low difficulty.

# Highlights- 
Though we had various concepts in consideration, Drone delivery stood out as we were able to target business and human needs that are feasible, and viable. Drone delivery has the potential to solve several of the pain points faced by customers, especially young working millennials before, during, and after shopping. With drone delivery, customers no longer need to worry about finding a parking spot or having limited time to visit a store. They can easily order products online and receive their deliveries within a short period of time, eliminating the need to wait in long checkout queues and reducing the high delivery charges often associated with online shopping. Improving customer satisfaction and experience is a top priority for us. Overall, drone delivery has the potential to revolutionize the way we shop and deliver goods, making it a game-changer in the delivery industry.

# Conclusion - 
We will share some of the progress made in the creation of the Prototype of the App.
